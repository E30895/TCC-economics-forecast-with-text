# ABSTRACT

This repository explores new tools from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis applied to economics, with a focus on using text data for macroeconomic forecasting. It includes the construction of two textual indices: the Economic Sentiment Index (TESI) and the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (TEPU), applied across five economic categories. The results demonstrate that these textual variables provide significant predictive power for Brazil's GDP growth rate, particularly in short-term forecasts, outperforming traditional benchmarks and proving valuable in the absence of conventional economic indicators.
